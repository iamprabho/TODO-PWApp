# Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web apps that use service workers, manifests, and other web-platform features combined with progressive enhancement to give users an experience on par with native apps.
# Components
Service Worker: The service worker transforms the website into an app by allowing it to download and cache files on a device.

Web Manifest: This JSON file provides the basic meta-information about the app, such as the app icon, background color, etc.

Secure HTTPS: HTTPS is mandatory and makes PWAs more secure than regular web apps.
